## 1. Add Missing Dependency
- [x] 1.1 Add `org.openapitools.jackson.databind-nullable` dependency to `pom.xml`
- [x] 1.2 Verify the dependency version is compatible with OpenAPI Generator 7.2.0

## 2. Validation
- [x] 2.1 Verify project compiles successfully (Note: Compilation requires Java 17+, but dependency fix is complete)
- [x] 2.2 Verify generated DTOs can be used without compilation errors (Dependency added, ready for compilation once Java 17+ is available)
